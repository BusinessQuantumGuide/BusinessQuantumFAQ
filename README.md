# BusinessQuantumFAQ
FAQ about the business side of quantum computing aimed at researchers in academia. 

This FAQ will focus on quantum computing (hardware & software) rather than broader quantum technologies (i.e. quantum sensing, quantum cryptography). While there are many interesting things to learn about the broader technologies, the business case for those is more obvious. When it comes to quantum computing, however, the business case is not so clear, given that the development of a useful fault-tolerant quantum computer might still be quite some time in the future. The purpose of this FAQ is to explain the business case for quantum computing, given this context, to reserachers from an academic background.
