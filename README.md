# BusinessQuantumFAQ
FAQ about the business side of quantum computing aimed at researchers in academia. 

This FAQ will focus on quantum computing (hardware & software) rather than broader quantum technologies (i.e. quantum sensing, quantum cryptography). While there are many interesting things to learn about the broader technologies, the business case for those is more obvious. When it comes to quantum computing, however, the business case is not so clear (at least to reserachers in academia), given that the development of a useful fault-tolerant quantum computer might still be quite some time in the future. The purpose of this FAQ is to explain the business case for quantum computing, given this context, to reserachers from an academic background. 

## Potential Questions

### What is a venture capital firm and what do they do?

### Why would someone invest in a quantum computing startup?
- Arguably the point is to make a return on the investment.
- Discuss exit strategies

### Why are businesses interested in investing in quantum computing *now*?
- Quantum Insurance [1]
  - You donâ€™t want to get blindsided and find out from others what is possible. You should have a quantum strategy and contingency plans.
  - If you wait for the technology to mature, it will be too late. You need to start training people that can hit the ground running as soon as the technology gets there. Training people takes time, literally years.
  - Technology timeframes are always shrinking. Twenty years ago, people thought quantum computing was a sci-fi dream. Ten years ago, most people believed practical quantum computers were 50 years out. Today, we think they are three to five years away.

### Why would established companies (IBM, google, Amazon, Microsoft) put so much money into developing a quantum computer?

### What are the common business relationships?
- A non-quantum business seeks advice from a quantum business about whether quantum computers can solve any of their problems, e.g. a pharmaceutical company wants to know if a quantum chemistry algorithm can help with drug design. 
- A manufacturer provides a service to a quantum company to help develop their technology, e.g. a foundry makes the chips for a photonic quantum computing company. 

### Why would a senior academic leave their cushy university position to start a quantum computing company? 

### How should I read/interpret (non-technical) news in this area?
